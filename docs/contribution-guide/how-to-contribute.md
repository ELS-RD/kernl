# Contributing guidelines

Our goal is to **make kernl development smooth**, **stable** and **open**.
We can't do this without our user community!
Please read this document before contributing!

## Code of Conduct

Kernl has adopted the **Contributor Covenant** as its **[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)**, and we expect project participants to adhere to it. 
Please read the **[full text](code-of-conduct.md)** so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open development

Kernl uses **[GitHub](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl)** as a source of truth. The core team works directly on it. All changes are public.

## Writing and formatting text

In a global way, texts in Issues, PRs and commits should be written **in English**, **with care**, **consistency**, and **clarity**.
Use (**[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)**) to structure your texts, and to make them more readable.

## Development Process

### Ask a question / share your ideas or new features

If you have a question, an idea for a new feature, or an optimization, you can **use the dedicated [discussion forum](todo)**.

**<span style="color:#fff; background:#ff0000">@reviewer: to be validated:</span>**
```markdown
@team:  what about creating a dedicated discussion forum?
        like Remix: https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions or Vite for example
            Proposed categories:
            - General (That's what we communicate)
            - Ideas (open to ideas in general)
            - Q&A
            - Feature discussion (dedicated to features)
        @todo:  If you agree, create the discussion forum and add the link above.
```

### Issues

#### Bugs

If you think you've found a bug but don't have the time to send a PR, please:

- First, **make sure the bug has not already been reported** in the **[issue tracker](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl/issues)**.
- If you don't find a similar issue, **[open a new one](todo)**.

**Bug reports without a reproduction will be immediately closed.**

!!! tip annotate "tips for writing your Issue"

    - [x] Give a concise and explicit title to the problem so that you can quickly understand what it is about.
    - [x] Describe the problem clearly and in detail. Explain what is not working as expected, what you expected to happen and what happened instead. Include as much information as possible, all the steps you need to take to reproduce the bug, etc. If you have ideas on how to fix the problem, feel free to include them in your description.

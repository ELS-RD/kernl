        Thanks for your help to improve kernl.
        
        Important stuff:

        - We expect you to submit a real feature request and not just a basic idea.
        - The proposal doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be sufficiently elaborate. We will discuss and correct it if necessary.
        - For a more "casual" feature request, consider using the discussion forum.
